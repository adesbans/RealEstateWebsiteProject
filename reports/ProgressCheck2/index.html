    <h3>Video Demo</h3>
    <p>

    <p>
        Note: At the end, I also meant to include the one final thing I need to complete on the Available Housing page is the 
        filter ability along with the popup feature and Google Maps API.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
        Due to unforseen complications with the original API I was using, I am now using the 
        <strong><a href="https://rapidapi.com/datascraper/api/realtor-com-real-estate/endpoints">Realtor.com Real Estate API</a></strong> 
        from <strong><a href="https://rapidapi.com/marketplace">RapidAPI.com</a></strong>. This API provides me the same exact data 
        as before, so my data structure did not need to change and I just needed to update my variable names and heroku server. Moreover, 
        I have begun implementing the Google Maps API. This API has caused me a lot more trouble and it is not correctly implemented yet. 
        I aim to have it fully implemented by the next progress check.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <p>
        I finished the Request Maintenance and Rental Application pages. Both of them display neat forms that, when submitted, send an 
        email to an email address of my choice by using the Vue EmailJS feature. When I fully implement this page to work for my dad's business, these emails will be sent 
        to him, as he prefers to receive maintenance requests and new rental applications in email form. Additionally, I have started to 
        reformat my Available Housing page to accomodate for more filter options and for the Google Maps API to display a map with all 
        the property locations.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Concerns</h3>
    <p>
        For this project check, my greatest concern has been the Google Maps API. Even after following many tutorials and doing a lot 
        of research, I still couldn't get it to work correctly. I will continue working at it for the next progress check.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>
        For the first time, I learned how to send an email through a form on a website. I used the EmailJS Vue component to complete this 
        and learned more about how to implement other Vue components.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    
    <p>
       For the next Progress Report, I hope to have fully implemented the Google Maps API and have my Available Housing page complete. 
       Additionally, I would like to have made progress on the Authentication/Log-In feature.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        All I have left to do is to complete the Available Housing page and the Log-In feature. These are both difficult tasks, 
        but with the time left to complete this project, I still feel confident that I can finish it in time.
