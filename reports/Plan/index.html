    <h3>Idea</h3>
    <p>
        My idea for my final project is to build a website for my dad's work. He works independently in real estate managing
        many properties and tenants, but does not have a centralized website that includes all important information for both him and 
        his tenants. He uses a handful of different programs to manage rental applications, paying rent, and posting new listings,
        and I would like to create a website that has all those capabilities. This would be extremely useful for my dad and his tenants.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>
        My website will support 4 main functions. First, it will have a page that displays all the available housing and all the 
        information for each available apartment. Second, there will be a page that lets potential tenants complete a rental application
        for an available apartment. Third, for current tenants, there will be a link that will let tenants pay their monthly rent. Fourth, for 
        current tenants, there will be a page that lets the user submit a maintenance request for the apartment they live in. Potential tenants
        will have access to the first two function and current tenants will have access to all four functions. When someone loads the page, they 
        will be considered a potential tenant until they sign in. Current tenants can sign in with their unique login, which will give them the 
        ability to either pay rent or request maintenance. Lastly, when my dad loads the page and signs in as the page administrator, he will also 
        have the ability to add or remove listings from the available housing page and see all of his aparments' info. In general, this page will use a combination of the Zillow API to 
        get housing data and some local data to display all the information about the apartments. Users will be able to input data in the form of either logging
        in, requesting maintenance, or submitting a rental application. An optional feature for my page will be to have a search bar in the available housing 
        page and a search bar at the top of the page for the administrator, allowing them to search within all of the site's data.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>
        All of the data for each apartment is stored on a site called <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" title="Zillow" target="_blank">Zillow.com</a>, which is a real estate site. I will use the 
        <a href="https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm" title="Zillow API" target="_blank">Zillow API</a> to dynamically fetch this data and implement it in my site. I will credit Zillow where necessary for the information I get using their 
        API. I will pair this data with any local data that I need to properly implement all of my desired functions.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Data Structure</h3>
    <p>
        I will have a local JavaScript file that holds my local data. I will dynamically fetch the rest of my data for each 
        apartment using the Zillow API.
    </p>
