    <h3>Video Demo</h3>
    <p>
        Watch demo <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/0c7481b1d8b54e71a72f8fc37c19955b">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: When discussing my Available Housing page, I meant to say that I will be using the <strong>Google Maps API</strong>. 
        Additionally, I will be implementing the Log In feature in a future progress check, and I just wanted to explain its 
        intended functionality for this progress check. Last, I will be adding more criteria that a user can use to filter which 
        properties are displayed in the Available Housing page.
    </p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
        I am fetching my data using the <strong><a href="https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realtor">Realtor API</a></strong> from 
        <strong><a href="https://rapidapi.com/marketplace">RapidAPI.com</a></strong>. For now, I am fetching data on homes for sale in 
        Durham. This gives me all the data I need to implement functions to meet the final project's requirements while also letting 
        me build a good frame on which I can build my final website for my dad after this semester. From the data, I currently display 
        the address, price of the home, square footage of the home, and image of the outside of the property, and how many beds and 
        baths the property has. Going forward, I plan on using the address of the home in conjunction with the Google API to be able to 
        display all the properties on a map. See the JSON data I use <a href="jsondata.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <p>
        I have built my landing page for my website and also integrated my API. Further, I have made progress on the Pay Rent, About Us, 
        and Available Housing page. I still need to implement the Log In feature, Rental Application page, and Request Maintenance page. 
        I also need to implement the Google API into my Available Housing page.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Concerns</h3>
    <p>
        My greatest concern is my server that I used for my final project. I am currently using the same server that I used in my 
        DataList project because both projects use the same API. Moving forward, if I need to change anything on the server for my 
        final project, it may impact the performance of my DataList project. I will need to figure out if I need to create an entirely 
        new app for my final project, which may be difficult because I had hoped that my DataList server could be used for my final project 
        as well.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>
        In my work for this Progress Report, I have learned more about how a backend server works with a frontend user interface. Through most 
        of the DataList project, I was pretty lost and confused on how the two connected, but now that I am going through the same process again 
        for the final project, I am now understanding how they work together and I find it really interesting. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    
    <p>
       For the next Progress Report, I hope to have the Rental Application and Request Maintenance pages complete. I also hope to refine 
       the appearance of my Available Housing page and start to implement the Google API with it.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        I am feeling optimistic about my final project's progress and think it is very feasible to complete by the end of the semester.
