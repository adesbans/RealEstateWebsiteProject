        <strong>NOTE:</strong> I was unable to change my directory to match the project specifications. When I tried to change it, I got 
        several errors that were not occuring beforehand. As a result, in order to have a functioning app, I did not change my directory.
        My JavaScript files can be found in the /ui and /server folders. My /assets folder is within the /ui folder. My secrets.js files 
        can be found in the /ui and /server folders. My /dist folder can be found in the /ui folder. Other than that, the rest of the 
        directory should be correct.

    <h3>Project Idea Description</h3>
    <p>
        My idea for my final project was to build a website for my dad's work. He works independently in real estate managing
        many properties and tenants, but does not have a centralized website that includes all important information for both him and 
        his tenants. He uses a handful of different expensive programs to manage rental applications, paying rent, and posting new listings,
        and I created a website that has all those capabilities. This would be extremely useful for my dad and his tenants.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>How My Project Works</h3>
    <p>
        My website supports 4 main functions. First, it has a page that displays all the available housing and all the 
        information for each available apartment. Second, there is a page that lets potential tenants complete a rental application
        for an available apartment. Third, for current tenants, there is a link that will let tenants pay their monthly rent. Fourth, for 
        current tenants, there is a page that lets the user submit a maintenance request for the apartment they live in. When someone visits 
        the website, they are able to log in using their Gmail account. Users are categorized as guests, tenants, or administrators in my code 
        when they log in. A guest will only be able to view available housing and complete a rental application. A tenant will have the same 
        abilties and will also be able to pay their monthly rent or request maintenance. An administrator can log in and will see "In Admin Mode" 
        at the top of the screen. I plan to implement more abilities for an administrator as I continue to work on this website for my dad.
    </p>

    <h3>Attributions</h3>
    <p>
        All of the data for each apartment is stored on a site called <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" title="Zillow" target="_blank">Zillow.com</a>, 
        which is a real estate site. I  use the <a href="https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm" title="Zillow API" target="_blank">Zillow API</a> 
        to dynamically fetch this data and implement it in my site. I  credit Zillow where necessary for the information I get using their API. When a user clicks on an individual property 
        or clicks the "See Images" button on a property, my site makes an additional call to my API and fetches more data to display. Moreover, I use 
        the <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/" title="EmailJS" target="_blank">EmailJS</a> Vue component on the "Rental Application" and "Request Maintenance" 
        pages. This allows the forms to be sent as emails. The Log In/Log Out feature uses <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis" title="EmailJS" target="_blank">
        Google's Cloud Services</a> in order to allow users to log in with their Gmail account. Last, the map under my "Avilable Housing" page is displayed using 
        the <a href="https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/" title="Leaflet" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> Vue component.
