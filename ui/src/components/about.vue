              About Us
            </h1>
            <p>
              We are a real estate management group that's highest priority is putting the tenant first. Throughout our entire rental 
              and housing process with Desbans Realty Group, you will benefit from help catered specifically to you. Our service is unmatched 
              because we have centralized all the necessary needs for both our tenants and administrator in one location - visitors can 
              view all available housing and submit a rental application, current tenants can login to pay their rent or request maintenance,
              and our administrator can log in to edit the available housing listings. Potential tenants can sign in and will have the ability 
              to create a "Favorite Properties" list that is unique to their account. This will make everyone's lives easier and should create
              a better living experience for all of our tenants.
